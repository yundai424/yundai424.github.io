Hello!

I'm Yun, a Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI working on post-training. Before that, I was at Windsurf writing code that writes code, and at LinkedIn making GPUs go _brrr_. 

I studied Biology and Journalism at Tsinghua University (B.S. '18), spent a year exploring social science at the University of Chicago, and later earned a Master's in Computer Science from UC Irvine.

My technical interests include large-scale distributed training and inference, reinforcement learning infrastructure, and ML systems broadly. I also enjoy keeping up with the latest research in post-training and multimodal LLMs. I'm especially curious about the intersection of AI and the social sciences. 

Outside of machine learning, I like to stay active (🏂, 🧗, 🏋️), do some handcrafting, read about sociology, and relax with my cats 🐈.
